The objective of this project is to apply machine learning approaches for an unsupervised classification of the estimated relaxation times and their intensities in order to study the effect of some design parameters (regularization parameter value, number of clusters) on the image content analysis results. The work will be conducted on both synthetic data and real images acquired with the MRI available IRSTEA Rennes. As illustrated in Figure 1, first results provided by K-means clustering algorithm confirmed the potential interest of this approach applied to a tomato sample.
